Developing Bika LIMS
====================

**How-Tos, Tips and Examples**

   * `Configuring a Bika LIMS development environment`_

   Before beginning, you will need to install a some tools and create a development copy of the source.

**Import/Export tools**

    * `Creating an instrument import interface`_

    The introduction of analyses results into Bika LIMS can be performed manually, but also automatically by using the results files generated directly by equipment or middleware software.
    
    * `Using JSON to connect with Bika-LIMS`_

    Bika includes plone.jsonapi for reading, updating, and creating and deleting objects. The JSON API is used internally for many AJAX requests, and also for implementing alternative interface.

**Customization of report templates**

    * `Creating new report templates`_

    The results report appearance can be modified easily modifying its template and by using TAL expressions.

**Other resources**

    * `Translations and localisation`_

    Bika uses zope.i18n and gettext to translate strings. This is the Plone standard, and the process is adapted from several Plone add-ons.
    
    * `External ID Server`_

    If you are installing a clustering setup with multiple ZEO servers, the content IDs generated by Bika will need to be unique among all servers. This article describes how to set-up an ID Server.
    
    * `Adding a view-specific JavaScript`_

    If you want to create a new JavaScript feature for a specific view, is better to use an specific JS file for each one avoiding to modify other views.
